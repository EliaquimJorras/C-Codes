## C Codes

Hello, this repository exists so I can attach to it small codes made in C. I am attaching these smaller codes here as a form of backup and to share with you my knowledge. I hope you like it!!!

Note: Most of these codes came from activities done in the computer science course I was taking and others came out of my own interest.
