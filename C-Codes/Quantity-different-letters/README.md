## Quantity Different Letters

The idea of this code is to calculate the amount of different letters in two strings together.

## Explaining the idea

- Take two strings. Example:
    ```
    Mary and Karl
    ```
- Count how many different letters appear in the two strings together:
    ```
    - The letter 'M' appears 1 time.
    - The letter 'A' appears 2 times: 1 in Mary and 1 in Karl.
    - The letter 'R' appears 2 times: 1 in Mary and 1 in Karl.
    - The letter 'Y' appears 1 time.
    - The letter 'K' appears 1 time.
    - The letter 'L' appears 1 time.
    ```
- We will have the different letters that make up the strings:
    ```
    M A R Y K L
    ```
- In the end, just count how many different letters there are and then return that value:
    ```
    Putting the strings together, there are 6 different letters.
